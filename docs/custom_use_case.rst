Use Case Implementation
=======================

This page explains how **EnerGNN** can be leveraged to address your own custom use cases.
But first, make sure to check the :doc:`basics` and :doc:`tutorial_notebook` pages.

Each use case implementation shall encompass their underlying business logic:

- How input data (i.e., **contexts**, see :term:`Context`) are defined and loaded in memory,
- How output data (i.e., **decisions**, see :term:`Decision`) should look like,
- How the gradient shall be estimated (closed-form for supervised learning vs.
  Monte Carlo estimation for more complex cases, minimizing the **objective function**, see :term:`Objective Function`).

Depending on the use case, very different implementation choices can be made, but all should respect the interface
defined in :mod:`energnn.problem`.

The following guide walks you through the major steps in implementing your own **EnerGNN** use case.

Overview
--------

Implementing your custom use case requires the following class implementations.

1. :term:`Problem` (:class:`~energnn.problem.Problem`) -- Implements the logic for a single **problem** instance (context, gradient, score).
2. :term:`Problem Batch` (:class:`~energnn.problem.ProblemBatch`) -- Handles **batching** of multiple problem instances together. The implementation
   can be optimized for parallel computation, and even leverage GPU parallelization.
3. :class:`~energnn.problem.ProblemLoader` -- Iterates over a whole dataset of problems,
   by returning a different **problem batch** at every iteration.

All three classes should however share two common properties, :attr:`~energnn.problem.Problem.context_structure`
and :attr:`~energnn.problem.Problem.decision_structure`, which define the name of the object classes and of their
respective ports and features appearing in **contexts** and **decisions**.

----------

Step 0 — Define Graph Structures
--------------------------------

**EnerGNN** uses the class :class:`~energnn.graph.GraphStructure` to understand the format of your data.
You must define a structure
for your **contexts** (see :term:`Context`) and your **decisions** (see :term:`Decision`).
They are mandatory properties for your :class:`~energnn.problem.Problem`, :class:`~energnn.problem.ProblemBatch`
and :class:`~energnn.problem.ProblemLoader` implementations.

.. code-block:: python

    from energnn.graph import HyperEdgeSetStructure, GraphStructure

    # Example: a context graph with lines, switches, generators and loads
    CONTEXT_STRUCTURE: GraphStructure = GraphStructure.from_dict(hyper_edge_set_structure_dict={
        "lines": HyperEdgeSetStructure.from_list(port_list=["bus1", "bus2"], feature_list=["r", "x"]),
        "switches": HyperEdgeSetStructure.from_list(port_list=["bus1", "bus2"], feature_list=None),
        "generators": HyperEdgeSetStructure.from_list(port_list=["bus"], feature_list=["p0", "q0"]),
        "loads": HyperEdgeSetStructure.from_list(port_list=["bus"], feature_list=["p", "q"]),
    })

    # Let us say that we wish to predict a log-probability for each switch to be open,
    # along with a generation variation.
    DECISION_STRUCTURE: GraphStructure = GraphStructure.from_dict(hyper_edge_set_structure_dict={
        "switches": HyperEdgeSetStructure.from_list(port_list=None, feature_list=["log_prob"]),
        "generators": HyperEdgeSetStructure.from_list(port_list=None, feature_list=["delta_p"]),
    })

**Important constraints:**

1. All classes in the **context** shall be at least of order 1 (i.e., have 1 or more ports);
2. All classes appearing in the **decision** shall also be appearing in the **context**;
3. No port can be predicted by the GNN, so all attributes :code:`port_list` in the decision structure shall be None;

For now, there is no support for global features (i.e., that would not be borne by a specific object),
but feel free to reach out if that's something you would like to see included.

------------------

Step 1 — Implement the Problem Interface
----------------------------------------

Your implementation of the class :class:`~energnn.problem.Problem` should represent a single problem instance.
You must implement the following properties:

- :attr:`~energnn.problem.Problem.context_structure`,
- :attr:`~energnn.problem.Problem.decision_structure`,

And the following methods:

- :meth:`~energnn.problem.Problem.get_context`: Returns the **context** graph :math:`x`,
  instantiated as a :class:`~energnn.graph.JaxGraph`,
- :meth:`~energnn.problem.Problem.get_gradient`: Computes :math:`\nabla_y f(y;x)` for a given **decision** :math:`y`,
  instantiated as a :class:`~energnn.graph.JaxGraph`,
- :meth:`~energnn.problem.Problem.get_score`: Computes :math:`f(y;x)` for a given **decision** :math:`y` as a :code:`float`.

**Tracking relevant quantities**:
All three methods have a key word argument :attr:`get_info` to trigger an optional behavior.
If :code:`True`, these methods return optional dictionaries that are passed to your experiment tracker.
It's useful for debugging and tracking, but not necessary in your first implementation.

**Data representation**:
Contexts, decisions and gradients are all instantiated as :class:`~energnn.graph.JaxGraph`, which is a version of
:class:`~energnn.graph.Graph` designed to work seamlessly with JAX.

**Decoupling gradients and score**:
You can use different objective functions in :meth:`~energnn.problem.Problem.get_score`
and in :meth:`~energnn.problem.Problem.get_gradient`.
For instance, you can use a non-differentiable function :math:`f` as a score, and a differentiable function :math:`f'`
in :meth:`~energnn.problem.Problem.get_gradient`.
Loosely speaking, :meth:`~energnn.problem.Problem.get_score` just has to return a scalar value that quantifies how good
a decision is, and :meth:`~energnn.problem.Problem.get_gradient` just has to return the opposite of a direction of
improvement for a decision.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Any
    import jax.numpy as jnp
    from energnn.graph import Graph, JaxGraph, GraphStructure
    from energnn.problem import Problem

    class MyProblem(Problem):
        def __init__(self, path: Any):
            # Implement your own data import, and store relevant state data
            self.context, self.state: tuple[JaxGraph, Any] = self._import_from_pypowsybl(path)

        @property
        def context_structure(self) -> GraphStructure:
            return CONTEXT_STRUCTURE

        @property
        def decision_structure(self) -> GraphStructure:
            return DECISION_STRUCTURE

        def get_context(self, get_info: bool = False) -> tuple[JaxGraph, dict[str, Any]]:
            return self.context, {}

        def get_gradient(self, *, decision: JaxGraph, get_info: bool = False) -> tuple[JaxGraph, dict[str, Any]]:
            # Implement your own gradient estimation method
            grad: JaxGraph = self._estimate_gradient(decision, self.state)
            return grad, {}

        def get_score(self, *, decision: JaxGraph, get_info: bool = False) -> tuple[float, dict[str, Any]]:
            # Implement your own score estimation method
            grad: float = self._estimate_score(decision, self.state)
            return grad, {}

        def save(self, path):
            # Implement your own save method
            pass

        @classmethod
        def load(cls, path):
            # Implement your own load method
            pass

Step 2 — Handle Batching (Problem Batch)
----------------------------------------

To train efficiently on GPUs, multiple problems are grouped together into a **problem batch** (:term:`Problem Batch`).
The batch interface mirrors the :term:`Problem` interface but operates on concatenated graphs.

It is very common that the different problem instances within a batch have a different amount of objects for a given class.
For instance, consider a batch with 2 instances, where:

- The first **context** has 5 switches,
- The second **context** has 7 switches.

To collate them together, we have to pad the first **context** with 2 fictitious switches, so that the two **contexts**
end up having the same number of switches.
The following code snippet shows how to do so.

.. code-block::

    from energnn.graph import Graph, GraphShape, collate_graphs, max_shape, separate_graphs

    context_1: Graph = ...
    context_2: Graph = ...

    # Step 1 : Get the two graph shapes
    # The true_shape property computes the number of non fictitious objects of each class
    shape_1 = context_1.true_shape
    shape_2 = context_2.true_shape

    # Step 2 : Compute the largest shape
    # It computes for each object class the maximum number of objects in the list
    max_shape = max_shape([shape_1, shape_2])

    # Step 3 : Pad all contexts with fictitious objects if required
    context_1.pad(max_shape)
    context_2.pad(max_shape)

    # The true_shape property is not altered by the padding, but the current_shape is.

    # Step 4 : Collate contexts together
    context_batch = collate_graphs([context_1, context_2])

    # Et voilà, you have a context batch filled with fictitious objects if necessary.
    # We can pass it to a model to compute a batch of decisions.
    # The EnerGNN models are implemented to return 0 values on fictitious objects,
    # And to keep track of which objects actually are fictitious or not.
    decision_batch = my_model.forward_batch(context_batch)

    # Wait... What if we need to split this batch of decisions,
    # and get rid of fictitious objects ?

    # Step 5 : Split decisions apart
    decision_1, decision_2 = separate_graphs(decision_batch)

    # Step 6 : Unpad decisions
    decision_1.unpad()
    decision_2.unpad()

    # And now we have decisions without any fictitious object!

The following :class:`~energnn.problem.ProblemBatch` implementation assumes that :

- Single :class:`~energnn.problem.Problem` instances have been generated and saved beforehand,
- The gradient computation can be performed in batch,
- A :code:`max_shape` has been computed over the whole dataset.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Any
    from energnn.problem import ProblemBatch, Problem
    from energnn.graph import JaxGraph, Graph, GraphStructure, collate_graphs

    class MyBatch(ProblemBatch):
        def __init__(self, path_list: list[str], max_shape: GraphShape):

            self.problems: list[MyProblem] = [MyProblem.load(path) for path in path_list]

            # Get all contexts, pad them and collate them together.
            context_list, _ = zip([pb.get_context() for pb in self.problems])
            np_context_list = [context.to_numpy_graph() for context in context_list]
            [np_context.pad(max_shape) for np_context in np_context_list]
            np_context_batch = collate_graphs(np_context_list)
            self.context_batch = JaxGraph.from_numpy_graph(np_context_batch)

        @property
        def context_structure(self) -> GraphStructure:
            return CONTEXT_STRUCTURE
        
        @property
        def decision_structure(self) -> GraphStructure:
            return DECISION_STRUCTURE

        def get_context(self, get_info: bool = False) -> tuple[JaxGraph, dict[str, Any]]:
            return self.context_batch, {}

        def get_gradient(self, *, decision: JaxGraph, get_info: bool = False) -> tuple[JaxGraph, dict[str, Any]]:
            batch_grad = self._compute_batch_grad(decision, self.problem_list)
            return batch_grad, {}

        def get_score(self, *, decision: JaxGraph, get_info: bool = False) -> tuple[list[float], dict[str, Any]]:
            score_list = self._compute_score_list(decision, self.problem_list)
            return score_list, {}

Step 3 — Data Loading (ProblemLoader)
-------------------------------------

The :class:`energnn.problem.ProblemLoader` is an iterator that yields batches.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Any, Iterator
    from energnn.problem import ProblemLoader, ProblemBatch

    class MyLoader(ProblemLoader):
        def __init__(self, dataset: list[str], batch_size: int, shuffle: bool = False):
            self.dataset = dataset
            self.batch_size = batch_size
            self.shuffle = shuffle
            self._current_idx = 0

        def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[ProblemBatch]:
            # Handle shuffling if needed
            self._current_idx = 0
            return self

        def __next__(self) -> ProblemBatch:
            if self._current_idx >= len(self.dataset):
                raise StopIteration
            
            # Slice dataset and return a MyBatch instance
            path_list = self.dataset[self._current_idx:self._current_idx+self.batch_size]
            self._current_idx += self.batch_size
            return MyBatch(path_list)

        def __len__(self) -> int:
            return len(self.dataset) // self.batch_size

Interface Checklist
-------------------

When implementing your custom use case, ensure these requirements are met:

- ``context_structure`` and ``decision_structure`` properties are defined.
- ``get_context()`` returns a :class:`energnn.graph.JaxGraph`.
- ``get_gradient()`` returns a :class:`energnn.graph.JaxGraph` with the same topology as the decision.
- ``get_score()`` returns a scalar (for :class:`~energnn.problem.Problem`)
  or a list of scalars (for :class:`~energnn.problem.ProblemBatch`).
- Graphs are correctly converted between :class:`~energnn.graph.Graph` (NumPy-based, useful for building/collating)
  and :class:`~energnn.graph.JaxGraph` (JAX-based, used by the models).

Summary
-------
By implementing these interfaces, your problem becomes fully compatible with EnerGNN's models and trainers.
You can find more practical examples in the :doc:`tutorial_notebook` or by looking at the ``tests/utils.py``
file in the repository.
